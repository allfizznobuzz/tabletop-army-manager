Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.","id":"be1e-ac8e-1e2c-3528","name":"Devastating Wounds","hidden":false,"page":28}],"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"24\"","name":"Range","typeId":"9896-9419-16a1-92fc"},{"$text":"6","name":"A","typeId":"3bb-c35f-f54-fb08"},{"$text":"3+","name":"BS","typeId":"94d-8a98-cf90-183e"},{"$text":"6","name":"S","typeId":"2229-f494-25db-c5d3"},{"$text":"0","name":"AP","typeId":"9ead-8a10-520-de15"},{"$text":"1","name":"D","typeId":"a354-c1c8-a745-f9e3"},{"$text":"Devastating wounds, Twin-linked","name":"Keywords","typeId":"7f1b-8591-2fcf-d01c"}],"id":"e305-23e6-6fd3-ac5f","name":"Twin Assault Cannon","hidden":false,"typeId":"f77d-b953-8fa4-b762","typeName":"Ranged Weapons","from":"entry"}],"id":"m09picpg1u8d1fyw386","name":"Twin Assault Cannon","entryId":"2b9d-9c13-9277-d157::e8d0-7c0f-df41-9d87::4641-242b-9584-c54a","entryGroupId":"2b9d-9c13-9277-d157::376d-e493-b439-19f4","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"group","group":"Wargear"}],"costs":[{"name":"pts","typeId":"51b2-306e-1021-d207","value":285}],"categories":[{"id":"dbd4-63-af05-998","entryId":"dbd4-63-af05-998","name":"Vehicle","primary":true},{"id":"5a61-81ac-eb7c-a87e","name":"Grenades","entryId":"5a61-81ac-eb7c-a87e","primary":false},{"id":"aff3-d6a3-2a95-9dc","name":"Imperium","entryId":"aff3-d6a3-2a95-9dc","primary":false},{"id":"6df-937-16bc-8c1a","name":"Smoke","entryId":"6df-937-16bc-8c1a","primary":false},{"id":"551d-174d-e214-52d6","name":"Land Raider Redeemer","entryId":"551d-174d-e214-52d6","primary":false},{"id":"6e7-40c-58d9-e402","name":"Faction: Adeptus Astartes","entryId":"6e7-40c-58d9-e402","primary":false},{"id":"75e8-57c4-40e3-1817","name":"Transport","entryId":"75e8-57c4-40e3-1817","primary":false}],"id":"m09picpgj3upt2fku8m","name":"Land Raider Redeemer","entryId":"2b9d-9c13-9277-d157::d361-a36e-1448-264d","number":1,"type":"model","from":"entry"}],"categories":[{"name":"Uncategorized","id":"mdp67208dvmlakqza46","primary":false,"entryId":"(No Category)"},{"name":"Configuration","id":"m09o8znx2h63rrpx282","primary":false,"entryId":"4ac9-fd30-1e3d-b249"},{"name":"Epic Hero","id":"m09o909rl7x7ven8ygl","primary":false,"entryId":"4f3a-f0f7-6647-348d"},{"name":"Character","id":"m09o909rofh1is6h64","primary":false,"entryId":"9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c"},{"name":"Battleline","id":"mdp67208hj80x4c6zgr","primary":false,"entryId":"e338-111e-d0c6-b687"},{"name":"Infantry","id":"m09o909rjic7sgyzqt","primary":false,"entryId":"cf47-a0d7-7207-29dc"},{"name":"Swarm","id":"mdp6720857anwkw1rkp","primary":false,"entryId":"b00b-5bae-444f-964e"},{"name":"Mounted","id":"mdp67209ayvqcpisg0v","primary":false,"entryId":"14a0-40c9-2748-ae6e"},{"name":"Beast","id":"mdp67209yagt2l6vybq","primary":false,"entryId":"4c3e-9310-a516-3590"},{"name":"Monster","id":"mdp67209kgp8ww0jb3n","primary":false,"entryId":"9693-cf84-fe69-37a9"},{"name":"Vehicle","id":"m09o909sjuhfsmscwlk","primary":false,"entryId":"dbd4-63-af05-998"},{"name":"Drone","id":"mdp67209wxkasaqv0bm","primary":false,"entryId":"2471-e2e0-3f55-d6cb"},{"name":"Dedicated Transport","id":"mdp67209g4ey3rhaw6p","primary":false,"entryId":"ba07-411c-2832-1f79"},{"name":"Fortification","id":"mdp672098a2v1eerrfe","primary":false,"entryId":"19d7-9c74-2140-5851"},{"name":"Unit","id":"mdp67209jlkcvguand","primary":false,"entryId":"1160-70ae-a862-b1a8"},{"name":"Allied Units","id":"mdp67209y1ytre24f3p","primary":false,"entryId":"887b-ab87-92a2-20f5"},{"name":"Illegal Units","id":"mdp6720afsfkfl3okcu","primary":false,"entryId":"(Illegal Units)"}],"id":"m09o8znwxknivrkwr0e","name":"Army Roster","entryId":"bb9d-299a-ed60-2d8a","catalogueId":"4ef9-15ce-e3e6-36de","catalogueRevision":47,"catalogueName":"Imperium - Adeptus Astartes - Blood Angels"}],"id":"m09o8zntd1yjx9j2wl7","name":"2k BA","battleScribeVersion":2.03,"generatedBy":"https://newrecruit.eu","gameSystemId":"sys-352e-adc2-7639-d6a9","gameSystemName":"Warhammer 40,000 10th Edition","gameSystemRevision":40,"xmlns":"http://www.battlescribe.net/schema/rosterSchema"}}
