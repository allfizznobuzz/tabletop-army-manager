You can only activate each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are then discarded. Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all units from your army with this ability until the end of the battle round.\n\nExample: **Ash makes their Blessings of Khorne roll and gets the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6. First they use the two 6s to activate Warp Blades (which requires a double 5+), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4.\nThey then use the two 2s to activate Wrathful Devotion (which requires any double), leaving the following dice: 1, 2, 3, 4.\nHowever, now that they have activated two Blessings of Khorne, they cannot activate any more and the remaining dice are discarded.**","id":"e68b-b42f-6f7c-4670","name":"Blessings of Khorne","hidden":false},{"description":"Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, it can move through models (excluding TITANIC models) and sections of terrain features that are 4\" or less in height.Â \nWhen doing so:\n- It can move within Engagement Range of enemy models, but cannot end that move within Engagement Range of them.\n- It can also move through sections of terrain features that are more than 4\" in height, but if it does, after it has moved, roll one D6: on a 1, that model is Battle-shocked.","id":"5e13-1624-d280-418d","name":"Super-heavy War Engine","hidden":false}],"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"12\"","name":"M","typeId":"e703-ecb6-5ce7-aec1"},{"$text":"13","name":"T","typeId":"d29d-cf75-fc2d-34a4"},{"$text":"3+","name":"SV","typeId":"450-a17e-9d5e-29da"},{"$text":"24","name":"W","typeId":"750a-a2ec-90d3-21fe"},{"$text":"6+","name":"LD","typeId":"58d2-b879-49c7-43bc"},{"$text":"8","name":"OC","typeId":"bef7-942a-1a23-59f8"}],"id":"eb16-9af1-520b-80f0","name":"Khorne Lord of Skulls","hidden":false,"typeId":"c547-1836-d8a-ff4f","typeName":"Unit","from":"entry"},{"characteristics":[{"$text":"At the start of the battle round, if this unit is on the battlefield, when you make a Blessings of Khorne roll, roll one additional D6.","name":"Description","typeId":"9b8f-694b-e5e-b573"}],"id":"1273-7c5a-b059-a2ba","name":"Idol of Blessed Blood","hidden":false,"typeId":"9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64","typeName":"Abilities","from":"entry"},{"characteristics":[{"$text":"While this model has 1-8 wounds remaining, subtract 4 from this modelâ€™s Objective Control characteristic and each time this model makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.","name":"Description","typeId":"9b8f-694b-e5e-b573"}],"id":"e2d3-e68e-870e-1355","name":"Damaged: 1-8 wounds remaining","hidden":false,"typeId":"9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64","typeName":"Abilities","from":"entry"},{"characteristics":[{"$text":"This model has a 5+ invulnerable save.","name":"Description","typeId":"9b8f-694b-e5e-b573"}],"id":"4c1c-e0c4-129a-6b90","name":"Invulnerable Save","hidden":false,"typeId":"9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64","typeName":"Abilities","from":"entry"}],"selections":[{"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Melee","name":"Range","typeId":"914c-b413-91e3-a132"},{"$text":"6","name":"A","typeId":"2337-daa1-6682-b110"},{"$text":"3+","name":"WS","typeId":"95d1-95f-45b4-11d6"},{"$text":"16","name":"S","typeId":"ab33-d393-96ce-ccba"},{"$text":"-4","name":"AP","typeId":"41a0-1301-112a-e2f2"},{"$text":"8","name":"D","typeId":"3254-9fe6-d824-513e"},{"$text":"-","name":"Keywords","typeId":"893f-9000-ccf7-648e"}],"id":"d303-1eb7-b9d0-af6b","name":"âž¤ Great cleaver of Khorne - strike","hidden":false,"typeId":"8a40-4aaa-c780-9046","typeName":"Melee Weapons","from":"entry"},{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Melee","name":"Range","typeId":"914c-b413-91e3-a132"},{"$text":"18","name":"A","typeId":"2337-daa1-6682-b110"},{"$text":"3+","name":"WS","typeId":"95d1-95f-45b4-11d6"},{"$text":"8","name":"S","typeId":"ab33-d393-96ce-ccba"},{"$text":"-2","name":"AP","typeId":"41a0-1301-112a-e2f2"},{"$text":"2","name":"D","typeId":"3254-9fe6-d824-513e"},{"$text":"-","name":"Keywords","typeId":"893f-9000-ccf7-648e"}],"id":"baf1-a42c-aa52-ac27","name":"âž¤ Great cleaver of Khorne - sweep","hidden":false,"typeId":"8a40-4aaa-c780-9046","typeName":"Melee Weapons","from":"entry"}],"id":"m8u9uydvb89m4u0e2bb","name":"Great cleaver of Khorne","entryId":"92f2-c2b5-a0c8-6e19::a267-97a0-25b1-8036","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"rules":[{"description":"Weapons with [RAPID FIRE X] in their profile are known as Rapid Fire weapons.
